# alexa-skill-plant-watering
Trying out building a custom Alexa skill to help with remembering to water the plants

## How this repository is used
In this repository I store design documents for the custom skill and `.py` files corresponding to the "Code" tab of the Amazon Developer Console for custom skills. This repository is designed as a sandbox for my experimentation purposes only and not for external contributions.

## Aims
- Build a functional custom Alexa skill for my own personal use
- Improve on Amazon's existing functionality for domestic reminders and task support

## Repository structure
```
- Skill Code # contains the .py files to create the skill logic
- Design Documents # contains the planning for the skill's functionality
```
Note that the configuration information from the "Build" tab of the Amazon Developer Console is not replicated here on Git.
